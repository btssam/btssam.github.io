    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>Hello! My name's Ben Samara and I am a game design student. I've been passionate about games my whole life. I studied at Quinsigamond Community College and graduated in May 2020 with an Associate's Degree in Interactive Media - Game Design. I have spent my free time researching game design in the past five years or so as well.
    <br>
    <br>
    Beyond that, I really do feel like a life-long student. I love to learn. I am deeply motivated by the arts and humanities, as well as the STEM fields. It's one of the reasons I am so interested in games - they combine the arts with technology and science. I enjoy writing, watching films and TV, reading, playing games, drawing - really most activities involved with learning or creating pique my interests.
    <br>
    <br>
    Looking forward, I would like to expose myself to and learn everything I can about the game design and development process. I have some experience with art, programming, and game design and enjoy them all. If I had to pick one of those I'm most interested in, it's game design. I would love to work in any role in a game development studio, helping to make the team's vision into a reality in whichever way I best can.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thank you for your interest and your time.</p>
